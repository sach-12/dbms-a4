# Gym Database Management System

This project is a part of my DBMS assignment in college.

The database being used is **Postgresql** due to its highly relational capabilities.

The backend API is supported by **Flask**.

The webpage is designed with basic **HTML/CSS** and vanilla **Javascript.**

To build the app, check out [build](build/README.md).

Source code of the application is inside `src`.
